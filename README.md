 # Mastermind Ruby

A small Ruby project with the game **Mastermind**, created to run in the terminal.

## About the Game

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where players either guess a color code generated by the computer or create a color code for the computer to guess.

### How to Play

- The game involves six colors: **black**, **blue**, **green**, **red**, **white**, and **yellow**.
- The program enforces valid color choices, so players cannot select colors outside this set.
  
Players try to guess the code within a set number of attempts (12). After each guess, the game provides feedback through color-coded pins, which offer hints about the accuracy of the guess.

### Feedback Pins

After each guess attempt, **pins** will indicate how close the guess is:

- **Red Pin**: One of the guessed colors is in the correct position and matches a color in the code.
- **White Pin**: One of the guessed colors is in the code but is not in the correct position.
  
> **Note**: The order of the pins does not correspond to the positions of the guessed colors (e.g., a red pin in first position does not mean that the first guessed color is correct and is in the correct position, but that one of the guessed colors is correct and is in the correct position).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install bundler if not installed already: gem install bundler
4. Install required gems ("colorize") running the command: bundle install
5. ruby main.rb
